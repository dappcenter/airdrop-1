# Saturn Network Airdrop Tool

Built with [Saturn Dapp Dev Kit](https://www.saturn.network/blog/ethereum-dapp-development-kit/)!

Easily organize and manage airdrops for your Ethereum or Ethereum Classic tokens, with more chains coming soon. Supports ERC20 and ERC223 tokens standards and their derivatives.

Code of this multi-chain dapp supports [these EVM blockchains](https://www.saturn.network/blog/what-is-evm-smart-contract-blockchain-overview/).

## Highlights

1. **Fast and Cost Efficient**. Because it utilizes smart batching technology, it is **up to 50x cheaper** to airdrop using this tool compared to alternatives.
2. **Tax efficient**. According to US laws, airdrops are now taxable events for US citizens and tax residents, with a few caveats. This airdrop tool uses a non-custodial smart contract wallet, protecting your users from unwanted IRS attention until they claim their airdrop.
3. **Easy to use and integrated with best DEX**. Users easily claim your airdrops from their [EVM account page](https://www.saturn.network/my-airdrops). Airdropped tokens automatically get integrated into our [Atomic Arbitrage Liquidity Mesh](https://blog.saturn.network/liquidity-for-all-eth-tokens-thanks-to-atomic-arbitrage/).
